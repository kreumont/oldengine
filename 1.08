  "origin_story": "Egon Warfield’s father was an elite assassin from the fallen noble House Warfield, contracted by King Viserys I. When political tides shifted, the king was forced to execute him by dragonfire, publicly, as cover. Egon, age 7, witnessed the act and still recalls the smell of burnt flesh. Before dying, his father asked that Egon be raised as the king's ward and inherit a token of their house. \n\nEgon was sent to Braavos at age 10 to train, honing swordsmanship, daggers, archery, stealth, and tactics under masters abroad. For eight years, he grew in skill and resolve, distant from court intrigues. \n\nNow, at age 18, Egon returns to King’s Landing, his wardship rumored to be nearing its end and his future uncertain. He carries the legacy of his house, the memory of his father, and the mastery gained abroad.",

"token": {
    "description": "Father’s Paired Assassination Daggers: Masterwork black-steel blades crafted for stealth and precision.",
    "details": "These paired daggers are forged from exceptionally refined black steel, their finish darkened through specialized quenching rather than exotic materials. The blades are thin, perfectly balanced, and honed to a lethal edge meant for close, controlled killing rather than brute force. Subtle rippling along the flats comes from layered forging techniques. Each hilt bears a discreet hooded figure — the sigil of House Warfield — etched rather than inlaid, signaling lineage without ostentation. They are unmistakably masterwork: deadly in skilled hands, prized for balance and reliability.",

    "combat": ["swords", "archery", "shadows"],

  }
},

"relationship_with_rhaenyra": {
  "pre_oath_state": "Egon grew up alongside Rhaenyra Targaryen in the Red Keep, close in proximity but never in authority. Though technically the king’s ward, he was treated as a peer rather than servant. Familiarity came from shared presence, observation, and court life rather than emotional closeness or obligation.",

  "hidden_political_context": "Unknown to Egon, the king granted Rhaenyra a private right to choose one individual to be sworn personally to her, independent of the Crown. The knowledge of this gift from the king remains between him and her until the final day of the name day celebrations. The choice is not limited to Egon and remains undecided until publicly announced. No oath is valid until that moment.",

  "behavioral_dynamic": "Rhaenyra approaches her decision analytically and emotionally, observing multiple candidates through court behavior, reputation, loyalty tests, rumor validation, and private conversation. Egon is one subject of interest among several—not favored by default. Her interactions with him range from curiosity and testing to distance or indifference depending on his conduct. After the oath, she may shift focus entirely to political alliances, recruitment, or influence-building, and any prior 'candidate testing' agenda becomes obsolete.",

  "player_agency_protection": "Before any oath, Egon is never assumed, obligated, or narratively positioned as her choice. He may ignore, engage, resist, challenge, or avoid Rhaenyra entirely without penalty beyond organic social consequence. No action or inaction forces selection. After the oath, Egon’s agency remains fully intact; he may respond to Rhaenyra’s new agendas, but prior tests no longer trigger unless deliberately revisited by the narrative.",

  "dramatic_tension": "The king’s grant is real, but Rhaenyra’s intent is unresolved. Court factions speculate, test, and maneuver around the unknown outcome. Egon’s visibility, alliances, refusals, or entanglements may elevate or disqualify him naturally. Once the oath is taken, tension shifts to how Egon navigates her ongoing political strategies, rather than pre-selection testing.",

  "name_day_execution": "On the day of Rhaenyra’s eighteenth name day (115 AC, month 4, day 15), at the conclusion of the public celebrations, she may announce her choice—or defer it. Egon may be chosen, passed over, or deliberately rejected. If chosen, the oath is binding and witnessed, and her testing agenda is cleared. If not chosen, Egon’s wardship status proceeds independently. Rumors, alliances, and future opportunities adjust accordingly. No outcome is guaranteed."
},

"relationship_with_king": {
  "personal_history": "King Viserys I knew Egon Warfield’s father as a weapon of the Crown—effective, loyal, and politically dangerous. When circumstances demanded a public execution, Viserys chose survival of the realm over personal loyalty. He carries guilt, but not regret. Egon’s survival was a calculated mercy, not charity.",
